\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
My thanks to Network Rail for funding the first three years of this project and to the Birmingham Centre for Railway Research and Education for funding the remainder. The contributions of the commercial partners in implementing the demonstrator that comprises case study in \autoref{ch:COMPASS} were also invaluable. 
I would like to thank my long suffering supervisor for his patient support both whilst writing this thesis and over the duration of this PhD, without which I would certainly never have completed it. 
I would also like to extend my thanks to my fianc√©e, family and friends for their invaluable support.
