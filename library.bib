abstract = {Copyright ? 2015 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.Real-Time Travel Information (RTTI) for rail commuters is still used inefficiently today and is rarely combined with other knowledge to come to a truly personalised and situation-aware multimodal travelling assistance. It is up to the travellers themselves to look for important info about their trip through static schedules or dedicated non-personalised applications. In a highly dynamic context such as that of public transportation, it would make life easier if one was able to consult the right information at the right time (removing superfluous information), for a variety of multimodal public transportation options, taking into account the context of the person travelling. In this paper we present the LimeDS framework, allowing application developers to rapidly define data workflows from a variety of data sources, deploy these workflows in a scalable and resilient manner and expose results to client applications as REST endpoints. A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) shows how our proposed framework can be used to tie together different open transportation data sources in order to create highly dynamic multimodal travel assistance applications by semantically enriching the data into knowledge, checking for ontological consistency and reason over the resulting knowledge.},

abstract = {Momentum is gaining to develop a Semantic Web to allow people and machines to share the meaning (semantics) of data and ultimately of applications. Key to the vision of a Semantic Web is the ability to capture data and application semantics in ontologies and map these ontologies together via related concepts. One approach for mapping disparate ontologies is to use a standard upper ontology. In determining how Semantic Web technologies might be applied to United States (U.S.) Government domains, the authors consider whether the use of standard upper ontologies makes sense in these environments. This paper attempts to examine current candidate standard upper ontologies and assess their applicability for a U.S. Government or U.S. Military domain. They evaluate the state of the art and applicability of upper ontologies through the lens of potential application in these domains. The evaluation includes consideration of the ontology purpose, ontological content decisions, licensing restrictions, structural differences, and maturity. The report concludes with some recommendations and predictions.},

abstract = {Nowadays there is too much data available. This is because almost every electronic device around us generates data. Usage of this resource is a must if one want to improve transportation. Having roads a variety of sensors installed, their data readability, comprehension and usage is of vital importance for a good traffic analysis. Data integration is needed to analyse information from these different sensors. Having this in mind, it is also known that this task is difficult if done manually, necessitating appropriate research and new techniques that can simplify such a task and preferentially automate it. The concept of ontology is particularly suitable to address data integration issue while maintaining their original meaning and representation. This paper explores the ontology concept so as to leverage data integration through a service-oriented architecture envisaging applications in transportation systems. Such a perspective allows potential clients to easily access heterogeneous data accounting neither for their original schema nor for their location and origin. To illustrate the approach, a prototype was implemented, which uses data from GPS logs, network topology from OpenStreetMap and counts from inductive loops.},

abstract = {The current evolution in the railway management software domain heads in the direction of highly modular systems with many different smaller components working together, tuned towards the operator's needs. In order to create an integrated management system for the train and railway domain in general, many different applications from both operators and manufacturers have to cooperate. To create a robust integrated system, a good supporting middleware infrastructure is needed. To the authors' knowledge, very few integrated or standardized techniques for creating higher-level intelligent middleware in the railway domain are publicly defined to date. The solution today towards establishing connectivity through the train makes use of a messaging bus. A service layer, providing mechanisms for e.g. life-cycle management, discovery and information aggregation, is however not provided in this current approach. Therefore, a distributed and modular architecture using ontologies, and widely used standards, such as Ethernet and IP, is detailed in this paper. The architecture provides the required intelligence needed for monitoring distributed applications in the train environment. The middleware allows information to be aggregated and analysed on different levels. Information querying, based on the ontology in the middleware is also discussed. By means of directory functionality, the ontology-driven middleware provides intelligent discovery as well. Finally, the ontologies used in the middleware to structure the domain and corresponding methods for creating such ontologies are presented. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper describes the Ontology of units of Measure and related concepts (OM), an OWL ontology of the domain of quantities and units of measure. OM supports making quantitative research data more explicit, so that the data can be integrated, verified and reproduced. The various options for modeling the domain are discussed. For example, physical quantities can be modeled either as classes, instances or properties. The design choices made are based on use cases from our own projects and general experience in the field. The use cases have been implemented as tools and web services. OM is compared with QUDT, another active effort for an OWL model in this domain. We note possibilities for integration of these efforts. We also discuss the role OWL plays in our approach.},

abstract = {In recent years, as a knowledge-based discipline, bioinformatics has been made more computationally amenable. After its beginnings as a technology advocated by computer scientists to overcome problems of heterogeneity, ontology has been taken up by biologists themselves as a means to consistently annotate features from genotype to phenotype. In medical informatics, artifacts called ontologies have been used for a longer period of time to produce controlled lexicons for coding schemes. In this article, we review the current position in ontologies and how they have become institutionalized within biomedicine. As the field has matured, the much older philosophical aspects of ontology have come into play. With this and the institutionalization of ontology has come greater formality. We review this trend and what benefits it might bring to ontologies and their use within biomedicine.},

The second part contains a description of the Geographic Data Files (GDF) standard. This is an ISO specification of how to store geographic information for intelligent transport systems. The structures in GDF, although primarily de- veloped for storing data, are already a sophisticated ontology for transport networks. They are, however, still described on paper, and not with a formal system for representing ontologies. Therefore we turned the more informal description of the GDF ontology in a formal OWL-based ontology. The result is OTN, an Onotology for Transportation Systems. OTN is very similar to GDF, with some extras. It is described informally in the third part of this deliverable.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The National Cancer Institute Thesaurus is described by its authors as "a biomedical vocabulary that provides consistent, unambiguous codes and definitions for concepts used in cancer research" and which "exhibits ontology-like properties in its construction and use". We performed a qualitative analysis of the Thesaurus in order to assess its conformity with principles of good practice in terminology and ontology design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used both the on-line browsable version of the Thesaurus and its OWL-representation (version 04.08b, released on August 2, 2004), measuring each in light of the requirements put forward in relevant ISO terminology standards and in light of ontological principles advanced in the recent literature. RESULTS: We found many mistakes and inconsistencies with respect to the term-formation principles used, the underlying knowledge representation system, and missing or inappropriately assigned verbal and formal definitions. CONCLUSION: Version 04.08b of the NCI Thesaurus suffers from the same broad range of problems that have been observed in other biomedical terminologies. For its further development, we recommend the use of a more principled approach that allows the Thesaurus to be tested not just for internal consistency but also for its degree of correspondence to that part of reality which it is designed to represent.},

abstract = {Evolving requirements may necessitate API migration-re-engineering an application to replace its dependence on one API with the dependence on another API for the same domain. One approach to API migration is to replace the original API by a wrapper-based re-implementation that makes reuse of the other API. Wrapper-based migration is attractive because application code is left untouched and wrappers can be reused across applications. The design of such wrappers is challenging though if the two involved APIs were developed independently, in which case the APIs tend to differ significantly. We identify the challenges faced by developers when designing wrappers for object-oriented APIs, and we recover the solutions used in practice. To this end, we analyze two large, open-source GUI wrappers and compile a set of issues pervasive in their designs. We subsequently extract design patterns from the solutions that developers used in the GUI wrappers.},

abstract = {In the last years collaboration platforms became an integral part of IT infrastructure in enterprises. Beyond document management for unstructured data, the main focus is now on collaborative work with structured data, which is an important part of the vision of the Semantic Web. Many local database solutions and a lot of spread sheets are being migrated to the new distributed information infra¬structure, where end users can easily relate data from virtually any source. Data can be located in corporate and/or cloud-based systems. Schema information and Meta data are available but (as always) not very popular. There is a strong demand for more integrity and a huge potential in adding more semantics to structured data. Merging schema information and data with ontologies allow applying reasoning techniques to this kind of data. The paper presents first experiences in using the collaboration platform Microsoft SharePoint together with semantic technologies for analysis, matching and classification. OWL mappings for content types and list elements enable an exchange of any kind of SharePoint data with semantic tools. Based on the Open Source application SemWeb we gave access to applications to ask SPARQL queries against data located in SharePoint. It was straight forward to setup Linked Data endpoints retrieving their data from SharePoint. Our main intent is to give SharePoint users access to semantic technology and vice versa let semantic tools access the large amount of structured data existing in corporate platforms. Glossaries maintained in lists and wikis are usually the starting point for terminological work. It was found to be quite useful for end users to edit ontologies directly in SharePoint. A simple triple store for classes, instances, and data and object properties was implemented, which can be mapped bidirectional to OWL and more sophisticated ontology editors. Visio connected to SharePoint is used as a graphical editor for data, Meta data and ontologies. Finally we present a practical use case where we applied this very pragmatic approach to a library of services in the E-Government context.},

Roughly speaking, we extend SHOIN with all expressive means that were suggested to us by ontology developers as useful additions to OWL-DL, and which, additionally, do not affect its decidability and practicability. We consider complex role inclusion axioms of the form R . S . R or S . R . R to express propagation of one property along another one, which have proven useful in medical terminologies. Furthermore, we extend SHOIN with reflexive, antisymmetric, and irreflexive roles, disjoint roles, a universal role, and constructs R.Self, allowing, for instance, the definition of concepts such as a '' narcist''. Finally, we consider negated role assertions in Aboxes and qualified number restrictions. The resulting logic is called SROIQ. We present a rather elegant tableau-based reasoning algorithm: it combines the use of automata to keep track of universal value restrictions with the techniques developed for SHOIQ. The logic SROIQ has been adopted as the logical basis for the next iteration of OWL, OWL 1.1.},

abstract = {This paper considers the development of an integrated robotic system which may be used to automatically locate and then systematically scan rolling contact fatigue cracks on rails to provide more detailed information on the cracks' sub-surface size. The system consists of a mechanised trolley, a robot, a commercially available AMIGO alternating current field measurement (ACFM) system and a laser distance sensor. The dynamic results, when the trolley moves at a controlled speed to detect defects, and the static results, when the defect location has been determined and the robot arm is used to characterise (size) the defect, are both considered. During field trials it was found that in the detection test most of the artificial cracks were detected automatically by employing a novel combined threshold and signature match (CTSM) method. The results of the characterisation test also suggest that the system can automatically take reliable constant lift-off ACFM measurements over the cracks at close to optimum range for characterisation where the relative angle offset between the ACFM sensor and the crack is bounded to be within 5°. {\textcopyright} IMechE 2013.},

The modularity of the ontologies allows for both detailed modelling of the domain at a high level and the storing of instance data at lower levels.

abstract = {Railways collect enormous amounts of data about the current state and use of their assets. Data collection system for work recording, track and rail measurement, asset databases, track charts, GIS maps, operations (scheduling), and engineering are required to operate a railway. The data from each of these systems have value on their own, but when aggregated together and analyzed produce a formerly untapped information source. The analysis of railway data is not new. What is new is that railways can now put in practice a continuous, consistent and controlled action and planning across the entire railway by automation of the analysis. This paper discusses the new and patent pending Analysis and Forecasting engine. The Engine is one of four parts of a system specifically designed to address the four Information Technology challenges of Corridor Infrastructure Management - 1: integration, 2: visualization, 3: data management, and 4: data analysis. The systems integration capabilities enable the connection of different data sources into a combined and linked data source. It provides visualization tools to see information within a database of thousands of kilometres and terabytes of data. The system provides the necessary data maintenance tools for data import and alignment. The system provides processing tools and a database to efficiently store and maintain thousands of kilometres of data. The system enables railways to experiment and apply rules quickly and efficiently without needing to develop new software. The Analysis and Forecasting engine enables a simplified method for processing and analyzing the unified data. The four elements provide an enterprise-class Corridor Infrastructure Management (CIM) system to enable management of a reliable, safe, planned, and cost efficient railway.},

abstract = {Railways are large, complex systems that comprise many heteroge neous subsystems and parts. As the railway industry continues to en joy increasing passenger and freight custom, ways of deriving greater value from the knowledge within these subsystems are increasingly sought. Interfaces to and between systems are rare, making data shar ing and analysis difcult. Semantic data modelling provides a method of integrating data from disparate sources by encoding knowledge about a problem domain or world into machine-interpretable logic and using this knowledge to encode and infer data context and meaning. Te uptake of this tech nique in the Semantic Web and Linked Data movements in recent years has provided a mature set of techniques and toolsets for design ing and implementing ontologies and linked data applications. Tis thesis demonstrates ways in which semantic data models and OWL ontologies can be used to foster data exchange across the rail way industry. It sets out a novel methodology for the creation of in dustrial semantic models, and presents a new set of railway domain ontologies to facilitate integration of infrastructure-centric railway data. Finally, the design and implementation of two prototype sys tems is described, each of which use the techniques and ontologies in solving a known problem.},

abstract = {Vehicles are nowadays provided with a variety of new sensors capable of gathering information about themselves and from their surroundings. In a near future, these vehicles will also be capable of sharing all the harvested information, with the surrounding environment and among nearby vehicles over smart wireless links. They will also be able to connect with emergency services in case of accidents. Hence, distributed applications based on Vehicular Networks (VNs) will need to agree on a 'common understanding' of context for interoperability, and, therefore, it is necessary to create a standard structure which enables data interoperability among all the different entities involved in transportation systems. In this paper, we focus on traffic safety applications; specifically, we present the VEhicular ACcident ONtology (VEACON) designed to improve traffic safety. Our ontology combines the information collected when an accident occurs, and the data available in the General Estimates System (GES) accidents database. We assess the reliability of our proposal using both realistic crash tests, held in the facilities of Applus IDIADA in Tarragona, Spain, and Vehicular Network simulations, based on the ns-2 simulation tool. Experimental results highlight that both nearby vehicles and infrastructure elements (RSUs) are correctly notified about an accident in just a few seconds, increasing the emergency services notification effectiveness. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study includes design, engineering, facilities management and business processes software systems, and redundant paper records management across all facility life-cycle phases. Based on interviews and survey responses, {\$}15.8 billion in annual interoperability costs were quantified for the capital facilities industry in 2002. Of these costs, two-thirds are borne by owners and operators, which incur most of these costs during ongoing facility operation and maintenance (O{\&}M). In addition to the costs quantified, respondents indicated that there are additional significant inefficiency and lost opportunity costs associated with interoperability problems that were beyond the scope of our analysis. Thus, the {\$}15.8 billion cost estimate developed in this study is likely to be a conservative figure.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The National Cancer Institute Thesaurus is described by its authors as "a biomedical vocabulary that provides consistent, unambiguous codes and definitions for concepts used in cancer research" and which "exhibits ontology-like properties in its construction and use". We performed a qualitative analysis of the Thesaurus in order to assess its conformity with principles of good practice in terminology and ontology design.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used both the on-line browsable version of the Thesaurus and its OWL-representation (version 04.08b, released on August 2, 2004), measuring each in light of the requirements put forward in relevant ISO terminology standards and in light of ontological principles advanced in the recent literature.

RESULTS: We found many mistakes and inconsistencies with respect to the term-formation principles used, the underlying knowledge representation system, and missing or inappropriately assigned verbal and formal definitions.

CONCLUSION: Version 04.08b of the NCI Thesaurus suffers from the same broad range of problems that have been observed in other biomedical terminologies. For its further development, we recommend the use of a more principled approach that allows the Thesaurus to be tested not just for internal consistency but also for its degree of correspondence to that part of reality which it is designed to represent.},

A simulation methodology used to model the performance of a wireless data communication system in a communication based train control system is proposed in this paper. This approach is developed within a simulation environment integrating with two simulators, which are BRaVE, a microscopic railway simulator and OMNeT++, a discrete event date network simulator. The architecture of these two simulators and the interfaces between them are introduced. The major challenges and constraints of data communication system for communication based train control systems are discussed and a co-channel interference model is proposed. A performance metric of wireless communication for measuring the system reliability is generated. Finally a case study is carried out to validate the proposed approach. Based on the simulation results in the case study, it can be found when the wireless connection between train and trackside access point is lost, further moving authority will be not able to generated for the trains.},

However, end-users' ability to retrieve, combine, and integrate heterogeneous geospatial data is limited. This paper presents a new semantic approach that allows users to easily extract, link, and integrate geospatial data from various sources by demonstration in an interactive interface, which is implemented in a tool called Karma. First, we encapsulate the retrieval algorithms as web services and invoke the services to extract geospatial data from various sources. Then we model and publish the extracted geospatial data to RDF for eliminating the data heterogeneity. Finally, we link the geospatial data (in RDF) from different sources using a semantic matching algorithm and integrate them using SPARQL queries. This approach empowers end users to rapidly extract geospatial data from diverse sources, to easily eliminate heterogeneity and to semantically link and integrate sources. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

The NCI Thesaurus is the reference terminology underpinning these efforts. It is designed to meet the growing need for accurate, comprehensive, and shared terminology, covering topics including: cancers, findings, drugs, therapies, anatomy, genes, pathways, cellular and subcellular processes, proteins, and experimental organisms. The NCI Thesaurus provides a partial model of how these things relate to each other, responding to actual user needs and implemented in a deductive logic framework that can help maintain the integrity and extend the informational power of what is provided. This paper presents the semantic model for cancer diseases and its uses in integrating clinical and molecular knowledge, more briefly examines the models and uses for drug, biochemical pathway, and mouse terminology, and discusses limits of the current approach and directions for future work.},

Interoperability between systems in these industries is currently poor, and opportunities for such analysis are often missed through unavailability of data. Semantic data modeling provides a mechanism for facilitating greater interoperability between systems, and allows easier integration of data from heterogeneous sources. This paper describes the current state of the art in rail data modeling, and introduces a asset monitoring system based on contemporary ontology and linked data (semantic data modeling) technologies. The design and implementation of Asset Monitoring As A Service (AMaaS) is shown, and overviews of key design patterns used to ensure extensibility and interoperability given. Finally, the potential for re-use of the system is discussed, along with known limitations and known technology advances. An outline of further work is provided, including in designing methodologies to foster uptake semantic data models across the industry.},

@article{GarciaMarquez2003,
abstract = {Over the past few years, there have been many advances in rail-based transport, i.e. higher speeds, increasing numbers of longer trains, shorter intervals between trains, greater axle loads, etc. Individually and together, these factors are resulting in the need for higher standards of track quality and associated infrastructure components. At the same time, railway undertakings have to minimise the expenditure on providing redundancy to cope with exceptional circumstances. Therefore, the most important performance characteristics required are greater reliability and reduced maintenance cost, while consolidating safety improvements.Turnouts are amongst the last remaining "fail hard" elements of the system railway and are exposed to severe environmental nfluences. There are now many situations where the failure of an individual turnout or a single switch rail can cause a total system shutdown with potentially very large losses, in terms of service reliability, operational schedules and financial consequences. Preventing such problems is therefore important for a reliable passenger and freight service. Wear is one of the most important factors affecting the reliability of railway turnouts. Consequently, a wear control method is required. Wear assessment mechanisms for railway infrastructure components often require remote monitoring of equipment condition, involving sensing of equipment states, transmission of the data collected and analysis of the signals. In any real environment, signals and measurements in condition monitoring systems can suffer from distortion and electrical noise. To be viable, the systems also require robust and reliable algorithms to detect faults. Noise could cause the system to indicate wear problems, where none exist reality.In preparing this paper, teams at the Universities of Sheffield (UK) and Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) have studied the application of remote condition monitoring (RCM) to the mechanisms used in railway turnouts and their operation. The authors put forward an algorithm to monitor wear related problems in turnout mechanisms and propose a Kalman filter for the linear discrete data-filtering problem. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

This will be achieved by enabling the use of advancing service planning and disruption management algorithms that will be interfaced to railway traffic management systems via a common middleware, as developed by the project team. The optimisation algorithms being produced by the project will require access to a wide-range of both static (infrastructure layouts, vehicle envelopes etc.) and dynamic (vehicle and crew positions, working timetable etc.) information on the state of the railway network in order to perform their calculations. While the heavily safety-critical culture that is prevalent within the railway industry has traditionally led to it lagging behind sectors such as automotive and healthcare in terms of ICT development, a number of initiatives have recently begun to create open data models that capture some or all of this data. Tasks 7.1 and 7.2 of the ON-TIME project focussed on the cataloguing and evaluation of the existing models with respect to the requirements of the various optimisation algorithms proposed and the state-of-the-art technologies available in the data mining domain. In particular the work aimed to identify gaps in the existing provision, where the project team could contribute additional material. A data dictionary was compiled, allowing the project team to easily access definitions of the various data types, review their availability within the project software architecture, and relate data concepts to implementation in the chosen data model.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: In the trade, transport and shipping sector, the Single Window (SW) concept has been evolved over time in a number of forms, reflecting respective policy, regulatory, market and technological regimes of the domain. A SW primarily addresses the need for efficient electronic transactions between governmental and business entities; however the SW service model adopted by the responsible authority and the offered SW system functionality differ; currently at least two distinct approaches are observed, namely a customs-centric SW approach, and a maritime and port centric approach. In all respective cases, the SW service model, the SW ownership model (public, private or Private-Public-Partnership), legal and regulatory aspects and the SW revenue model (free or with a fee) consist pertinent SW service design issues. Thus, different types of SW systems evolve in terms of offered service bundle, namely ship clearance, cargo import/export, or port clear- ance SWs, where often vested interests and policy choices dictate the dominance of one model implementa- tion over the other. Modern ICT tools may significantly help to organize and improve the efficiency of a SW design and implementation process. In this paper, admissible development frameworks and methodologies are examined towards the efficient implementation of SW service models that are explained. Our analysis is based on experiences gained in the Norwegian SW national initiative (http://www.sintef.no/Projectweb/MIS/) and the EU eFreight project (http://www.efreightproject.eu/).},

abstract = {This paper describes the application of a new knowledge representation standard to develop domain ontologies. It describes how Web Ontology Language (OWL) enables the capture of the semantics of railway RCM data structures to represent actual and historic asset RCM status information. This was achieved in the context of European railway integration, and in particular the InteGRail project, where the objective was to support improved decision making through the creation of an application independent railway ontology. This paper describes how this ontology was created with a structured design methodology, using design patterns extended by railway fault concepts and using the extended features of Description Logic (OWL-DL). The creation of a test architecture enabled sample data to be transformed into semantic information. This information was distributed across Europe, enabling the testing of reasoning mechanisms to access the OWL-DL content, finding implicit meaning from the explicit content. Initial tests indicate that the implementation of RCM based OWL ontologies can support more effective information management. This leads to improved maintenance processes and more effective associated operations.},

abstract = {As ontologies become more prevalent in biomedicine and other fields, effective on- tology alignment is a necessary for their economical and practical use. An ontology is a group of concepts derived from a corpus of knowledge. Ontology alignment determines the relationships between these concepts across different ontologies. Therefore ontology align- ment is an area of active research, especially scaling ontology alignment, as the number and size of ontologies increases dramatically. This thesis describes an approach and implementation of ontology alignment called Parallel Ontology Bridge, which maintains good alignment quality while increasing scala- bility and speed of ontology alignment by matching linguistic and structural features in a support vector machine. This approach is based on Ontology Bridge [1] and provides the same advantages. It is able to handle non-equivalence relationships very effectively and is a general approach to ontology alignment that can be used across many domains. Parallel Ontology Bridge increases scalability by using map-reduce, an approach to breaking down problems and running them in parallel. This thesis describes how this is done. Parallel Ontology Bridge is almost two orders of magnitude faster than Ontology Bridge and shows very good scalability while maintaining quality as measured through F-Measure. The results of Parallel Ontology Bridge are compared against several other scalability approaches, both with experimental data and theoretical maximum scalability. Parallel Ontology Bridge is significantly more scalable in the experimental data and maintains this advantage during theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A key ingredient in system and organization modeling is modeling business processes that involve the collaborative participation of different teams within and outside the organization. Recently, the use of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) for collaborative business modeling has been increasing, thanks to its human-friendly visual representation of a rich set of structural and behavioral views, albeit its unclear semantics. In the meantime, the use of theWebOntology Language (OWL) has also been emerging, thanks to its clearly-defined semantics, hence being amenable to automatic analysis and reasoning, although it is less human friendly than, and also perhaps not as rich as, theUMLnotation— especially concerning processes, or activities. In this paper, we view the UML and the OWL as being complementary to each other, and exploit their relative strengths. We provide a mapping between the two, through a set of mapping rules, which allow for the capture of UMLactivity diagrams in an OWL-ontology. This mapping, which results in a formalization of collaborative processes, also sets a basis for subsequent construction of executable models using the Colored Petri Nets (CPN) formalism. For this purpose, we also provide appropriate mappings from OWL-based ontological elements into CPN elements. A case study of a mortgage granting system is described, along with the potential benefits and limitations of our proposal. {\textcopyright}2009},

abstract = {The use of methodologies in software and knowledge engineering is very extensive due to their important advantages. In the case of the development of ontologies, until now, several methodological proposals have been presented for building ontologies. Some of these methodologies are designed for building ontologies from scratch or reusing other ontologies without modifying them, concretely, the following cases can be mentioned: the Cyc methodology, the approach proposed by Uschold and King, Gruninger and Fox's methodology, the KACTUS methodology, METHONTOLOGY and the SENSUS methodology. There is even a proposal for re-engineering ontologies, and several proposals for collaborative construction of ontologies. In this article, we describe the methodologies and check their degree of maturity, contrasting them with respect to the IEEE standard for software development. Before this, we justify to what extent this standard can be used. A conclusion to this study is that there is no completely mature methodological proposal for building ontologies, since there are some important activities and techniques that are missing in all these methodologies. However, all the methodologies do not have the same degree of maturity. In fact, METHONTOLOGY is a very mature methodology. The other conclusion of this article is that, although work to unify proposals can be interesting, maybe several approaches should coexist.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web has enabled the creation of a global information space comprising linked documents. As the Web becomes ever more enmeshed with our daily lives, there is a growing desire for direct access to raw data not currently available on the Web or bound up in hypertext documents. Linked Data provides a publishing paradigm in which not only documents, but also data, can be a first class citizen of the Web, thereby enabling the extension of the Web with a global data space based on open standards - the Web of Data. In this Synthesis lecture we provide readers with a detailed technical introduction to Linked Data. We begin by outlining the basic principles of Linked Data, including coverage of relevant aspects of Web architecture. The remainder of the text is based around two main themes - the publication and consumption of Linked Data. Drawing on a practical Linked Data scenario, we provide guidance and best practices on: architectural approaches to publishing Linked Data; choosing URIs and vocabularies to identify and describe resources; deciding what data to return in a description of a resource on the Web; methods and frameworks for automated linking of data sets; and testing and debugging approaches for Linked Data deployments. We give an overview of existing Linked Data applications and then examine the architectures that are used to consume Linked Data from the Web, alongside existing tools and frameworks that enable these. Readers can expect to gain a rich technical understanding of Linked Data fundamentals, as the basis for application development, research or further study.},

abstract = {The abundance and unstructured nature of biomedical texts, be it clinical or research content, impose significant challenges for the effective and efficient use of information and knowledge stored in such texts. Annotation of biomedical documents with machine intelligible semantics facilitates advanced, semantics-based text management, curation, indexing, and search. This paper focuses on annotation of biomedical entity mentions with concepts from relevant biomedical knowledge bases such as UMLS. As a result, the meaning of those mentions is unambiguously and explicitly defined, and thus made readily available for automated processing. This process is widely known as semantic annotation, and the tools that perform it are known as semantic annotators.Over the last dozen years, the biomedical research community has invested significant efforts in the development of biomedical semantic annotation technology. Aiming to establish grounds for further developments in this area, we review a selected set of state of the art biomedical semantic annotators, focusing particularly on general purpose annotators, that is, semantic annotation tools that can be customized to work with texts from any area of biomedicine. We also examine potential directions for further improvements of today's annotators which could make them even more capable of meeting the needs of real-world applications. To motivate and encourage further developments in this area, along the suggested and/or related directions, we review existing and potential practical applications and benefits of semantic annotators.},

sufficiently cover the CREMA use case domains of metal press maintenance

size being CREMA use case specific. The practical applicability of
CDM-Core for semantic annotation of domain-related process models,
sensor data and services has been approved by the user partners, and its
quality according to selected common criteria of verification and
validation was successfully evaluated. From the public release of the
CDM-Core, we expect to cover the lack of a base common ontology for the

abstract = {This study presents a generic ontology-based architecture using a multi-criteria decision making technique to design a personalized route planning system. The real world has become too complex to implement entirely within an information system such as geographic information system (GIS). A route planning technique is an essential geo-related decision support tool, especially in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In ubiquitous GIS environments, personalization can be accomplished through a user's preferences stored on mobile appliances. In this manner, personalized and user-centric route planning services using semantic technologies and ontologies perceive user and context models to satisfy user demands and predict their requirements. In the past few years, several studies have been carried out regarding personalized services. However, the existing route finding algorithms suffer from a number of major difficulties, mainly owing to insufficient criteria modeling for a personalized system. Thus, the present study investigates how a user-centric route planning system can be implemented. In order to address this research issue, an ontology-based knowledge modelling technique using an analytic hierarchical process (AHP) is proposed. This technique can facilitate determination of the choice of criteria used for applying an impedance function in the route finding algorithm. From another perspective, AHP explicitly deals with a hierarchy structure and is essentially a theory of measurement and decision making methodology used for combining or synthesizing quantitative as well as qualitative criteria. User-centric results on real data illustrate the strengths of the present approach.

abstract = {Abstract—Today, railway actors (including passengers and crew members) obtain information by actively hunting for relevant data in various places – manually linking their personal profile with public transportation time tables, floor plans from railway and underground stations, weather forecasts, etc. Despite the availability of a variety of travel-related data sources, accurate delivery of relevant, timely information to these railway actors is still inadequate. This paper presents a solution to the abovementioned problem in the form of a scalable software framework that is able to interface with any type of (open) data. The framework aggregates a variety of data sources to create tailor-made knowledge, tuned to the dynamic profiles of railway users. The needs of these railway users were extracted using novel user experience techniques in order to determine the requirements of this framework. The resulting OSGi-based framework architecture is two-layered. Core functionality, including predefined load balancing strategies, is implemented in the generic base layer, on top of which a use case specific layer – that is able to cope with the specifics of the railway environment – is built. Data entering the framework is intelligently processed and the result is made available to railway vehicles and mobile devices},

abstract = {The Geosciences and Geography are not just yet another application area for semantic technologies. The vast heterogeneity of the involved disciplines ranging from the natural sciences to the social sciences introduces new challenges in terms of interoperability. Moreover, the inherent spatial and temporal information components also require distinct semantic approaches. For these reasons, geospatial semantics, geo-ontologies, and semantic interoperability have been active research areas over the last 20 years. The geospatial semantics community has been among the early adopters of the Semantic Web, contributing methods, ontologies, use cases, and datasets. Today, geographic information is a crucial part of many central hubs on the Linked Data Web. In this editorial, we outline the research field of geospatial semantics, highlight major research directions and trends, and glance at future challenges. We hope that this text will be valuable for geoscientists interested in semantics research as well as knowledge engineers interested in spatiotemporal data},

abstract = {Condition assessment is crucial to optimize condition-based maintenance actions of assets such as railway infrastructure, where a faulty state might have severe consequences. Hence, railways are regularly inspected to detect failure events and prevent the inspected item (e.g. rail) to reach a faulty state with potentially safety critical consequences (e.g. derailment). However, the preventive measures (e.g. condition-based maintenance) initiated by the inspection results may cause traffic disturbances, especially if the expected time to a faulty state is short. The alarm limits are traditionally safety related and often based on geometrical properties of the inspected item. Maintenance limits would reduce the level of emergency, producing earlier alarms and increasing possibilities of planned preventive rather than acute maintenance. However, selecting these earlier maintenance limits in a systematic way while balancing the risk of undetected safety-critical faults and false alarms is challenging.Here, we propose a statistically based approach using condition data of linear railway infrastructure assets. The data were obtained from regular inspections done by a railway track measurement wagon. The condition data were analysed by a control chart approach to evaluate the possibility for earlier detection of derailment hazardous faults using both temporal and spatial information.The study indicates that that the proposed approach could be used for condition assessment of tracks. Control charts led to earlier fault warnings compared to the traditional approach, facilitating planned condition-based maintenance actions and thereby a reduction of track downtime.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional neuroimaging studies of bipolar disorder (BD) performed in conjunction with antidepressant treatment trials generally require that patients remain on mood stabilizers to reduce the risk of inducing mania; yet, it is unknown whether the metabolic abnormalities evident in unmedicated BD depressives remain detectable in patients receiving mood stabilizers. This study investigated whether cerebral metabolic abnormalities previously reported in unmedicated BD subjects are evident in depressed bipolar disorder type II (BD II) subjects receiving lithium or divalproex. METHODS: Using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography, cerebral glucose metabolism was compared between 13 depressed BD II subjects on therapeutic doses of lithium or divalproex and 18 healthy control subjects. Regional metabolism was compared between groups in predefined regions of interest. RESULTS: Metabolism was increased in the bilateral amygdala, accumbens area, and anteroventral putamen, left orbitofrontal cortex and right pregenual anterior cingulate cortex in depressives versus control subjects. Post hoc exploratory analysis additionally revealed increased metabolism in left parahippocampal, posterior cingulate, and right anterior insular cortices in depressives versus control subjects. Correlational analyses showed multiple limbic-cortical-striatal interactions in the BD sample not evident in the control sample, permitting sensitive and specific classification of subjects by discriminant analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm previous reports that bipolar depression is associated with abnormally increased metabolism in the amygdala, ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and anterior insula, and extend these results to bipolar disorder type II depressives on lithium or divalproex. They also implicate an extended functional anatomical network known to modulate visceromotor function in the pathophysiology of BD II depression},

abstract = {Dynamic at-stop real-time information displays are becoming more and more ubiquitous in modern public transport. Reactions and attitudes towards these systems are very positive. But there is a need to provide a comprehensive framework of the possible effects that these kinds of displays can have on customers. The seven main effects described in this paper are: (A) reduced wait time, (B) positive psychological factors, such as reduced uncertainty, increased ease-of-use and a greater feeling of security, (C) increased willingness-to-pay, (D) adjusted travel behaviour such as better use of wait time or more efficient travelling, (E) mode choice effects, (F) higher customer satisfaction and finally (G) better image. Two studies are presented in this paper. Study I supports and proves that perceived wait times can be reduced by 20{\%} by employing a before-after implementation evaluation study with questionnaires on a tramline. Study II shows the effects of real-time displays on behaviour in the form of adjusted walking speeds, by using a behaviour observation method in a subway station. The effect framework does not claim completeness and many effects are related to each other. However, the framework is a useful basis for designing evaluation studies and provides arguments in favour of at-stop real-time information displays. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This is achieved through the introduction of a ground breaking Technical Enabler based on two concepts:The traveler is placed at the heart of innovative solutions, accessing all multimodal travel services (shopping, ticketing, and tracking) through its travel-companion.An open published framework is providing full interoperability whilst limiting impacts on existing systems, without prerequisites for centralized standardization. This Technical Enabler will be completely settled in the context of the Shift2Rail IP4, and IT2Rail is proposing a reduced approach to the scale of a specified use case without weakening any of the key concepts of IP4, such as the usage of Semantic Web technologies, meta planning on distributed data, travel companion with a protected and secured personal wallet stored in the cloud and including the rights to travel. The use cases will be defined as specific instantiations of our open concepts, and will benefit from a completely scalable architecture fully instantiated in IP4. This approach is addressing all the key challenges of the work program, supporting a complete door-to- door multimodal travel offer and proposing a seamless integration of the very diverse existing and future services for planning, one-stop-shop ticketing, and real-time re-accommodation. Moreover, thanks to an Interoperability framework which insulates travel applications from the standards fragmentation in multimodal transport, IT2Rail liberates business-model innovations in the market-place, guaranteeing the economic self-sustainability of these e-services in the long-term.},

These ontology-based mappings and annotations are used in many applications and analysis tasks. Since biomedical ontologies are continuously updated dependent artifacts can become outdated and need to undergo evolution as well. Hence there is a need for largely automated approaches to keep ontology-based mappings up-to-date in the presence of evolving ontologies. In this article, we survey current approaches and novel directions in the context of ontology and mapping evolution. We will discuss requirements for mapping adaptation and provide a comprehensive overview on existing approaches. We will further identify open challenges and outline ideas for future developments.},

abstract = {Current train delay (TD) prediction systems do not take advantage of state-of-the-art tools and techniques for handling and extracting useful and actionable information from the large amount of endogenous (i.e., generated by the railway system itself) and exogenous (i.e., related to railway operation but generated by external phenomena) data available. Additionally, they are not designed in order to deal with the intrinsic time varying nature of the problem (e.g., regular changes in the nominal timetable, etc.). The purpose of this paper is to build a dynamic data-driven TD prediction system that exploits the most recent tools and techniques in the field of time varying big data analysis. In particular, we map the TD prediction problem into a time varying multivariate regression problem that allows exploiting both historical data about the train movements and exogenous data about the weather provided by the national weather services. The performance of these methods have been tuned through the state-of-the-art thresholdout technique, a very powerful procedure which relies on the differential privacy theory. Finally, the performance of two efficient implementations of shallow and deep extreme learning machines that fully exploit the recent in-memory large-scale data processing technologies have been compared with the current state-of-the-art TD prediction systems. Results on real-world data coming from the Italian railway network show that the proposal of this paper is able to remarkably improve the state-of-the-art systems.},

abstract = {We present a formal semantics for the Object Constraint Language (OCL) which is part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) - an emerging standard language and notation for object-oriented analysis and design. In context of information systems modeling, UML class diagrams can be utilized for describing the overall structure, whereas additional integrity constraints and queries are specified with OCL expressions. By using OCL, constraints and queries can be specified in a formal yet comprehensible way. However, the OCL itself is currently defined only in a semi-formal way. Thus the semantics of constraints is in general not precisely defined. Our approach gives precise meaning to OCL concepts and to some central aspects of UML class models. A formal semantics facilitates verification, validation and simulation of models and helps to improve the quality of models and software designs.},

Competition is no longer conceived as it was in traditional markets. In this global market, knowledge is considered an asset that has an economic value for an organization and a strategic resource used to increase productivity and offer stability in dynamic competitive environments. Such significance of knowledge implies the need for protecting this vital resource by safeguarding the right access, its persistence over time, and its adequate retrieval. In this work, we propose an organizational memory architecture, and annotation and retrieval information strategies based on domain ontologies that take in account complex words to retrieve information through natural language queries. To test these strategies, we implemented a flexible framework to experiment with knowledge retrieval approaches. Finally, experimental results are evaluated and analyzed through standard measures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Seldom do railroads have the resources to maintain their infrastructure at such a level to ensure steady-state performance. More often they are faced with the decision of which maintenance actions should take priority, so that optimal safety and reliability are maintained under the burden of constrained resources. The option of additional resources is rarely feasible. Given these current operating realities, more and more railroads are finding that the solution lies in utilizing information technology to work more efficiently. By harnessing the vast amount of existing rail corridor data into a prioritized plan, and then assigning the work and monitoring the execution and results with software tools, many railroads are attempting to do more with less. The strategy, we define as Prioritized Rail Corridor Asset Management, not only results in steady-state asset performance under constrained resources but can even improve the asset condition and provide a positive return on investment. This paper describes an information system developed to facilitate a Prioritized Rail Corridor Asset Management strategy. The enterprise-scale solution requires combining Optram's Railway Infrastructure Management (ORIM™) information system with MRO Software, Inc. (MROI) strategic asset management information system (MAXIMO{\textregistered}). ORIM integrates existing rail corridor data sources with a linear model of the track network to continuously generate a prioritized work plan. The prioritized work plan is linked to MAXIMO where staff, materials, and equipment are managed. The results combined with an effective execution facilitate a Prioritized Rail Corridor Asset Management strategy.},

On the one hand, we ex- tend the positive result for EL by identifying a set of expressive means that can be added to EL with- out sacrificing tractability. On the other hand, we show that basically all other additions of typical DL constructors to EL with GCIs make subsump- tion intractable, and in most cases even EXPTIME- complete. In addition, we show that subsumption in FL0 with GCIs is EXPTIME-complete.},
